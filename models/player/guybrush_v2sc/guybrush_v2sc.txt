Description:
My 3rd model.

Of course this is Guybrush Threepwood of Monkey Island Fame.  That goofball
pirate is now available for a little deathmatch action.  I decided to go
the cartoony look and keep the textures simple, since that's what lucasarts 
has done in MI4.  

Installation: Copy all files into Half-life/Valve/Models/player/guybrush

Distribution:
Distribute this model freely
Do whatever the hell you want with it.  Just remember if you get the notion 
to add any perverted enhancements he's copywritten by LEC.

Thanks to: valve for finally releasing the 2.0 SDK
