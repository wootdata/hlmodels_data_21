Model description       : Let me start off by saying I do not normally do requested clan
			  models or customize my models for clan use. If you ask, normally
			  I will ignore you. But the boyz in [JA] were kind enough and
			  gave enough mad props to prompt me to do this easy conversion for
			  them. Thanks to those guys and especially [JA]Rapid for actually 			  using one of my models :)

			  Lot's of complaints came in about the proportion's of the original
			  Limp models body. So I did quite a bit of tweaking on this one.
			  The result, a more shapely model, this time with the hat 			  backwards.
