Marshall Law skin and logo for Half-Life [5 March 1999]

Unpack the MLaw_halflife.zip to where you have drive where you have Half-life installed.
i.e. if it's  C:\Half-life unpack the zip to C:\Half-life  :)

Files are packed to the following dir's:..
\logos
\valve\models\player\MLaw

Files included are 
\logos:				Mlaw_logo.bmp
\valve\models\player\Mlaw	Mlaw.bmp and Mlaw.mdl and offcourse this text.

The .mdl file is the model you will see during play.  
The .bmp file is necessary for the model to be selectable via the launcher interface.  
For a player model to be visible to all clients playing, it must be installed on
the server for it to propogate to all playing clients.

When a model is downloaded from the game server, 
it does not download the .bmp file necessary for selecting the model in the interface: 
models must be deliberately installed by the player.
