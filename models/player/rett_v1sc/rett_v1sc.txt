Subject Matter: Rett, the mascot for Boston University.
He is a Boston Terrier, if you want to see what the real Rett looks like chechout www.gobu.com
for a picture of Rett.  Sorry if he is a little too tall, his head is kinda big.
Try to imagine that he is a guy in a character suit, like the kind you see at Disney World.
So if you ever shot mickey mouse in the head, youd actually be missing whoever was inside the suit.
Try to imagiune that this is what is going on here if you will.
